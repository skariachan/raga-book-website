    <h2><u>About</u></h2>

    <p>
        <strong>James Skaria</strong> is a Carnatic music <em>rasikan</em> who began his
        Carnatic journey in <strong>2024</strong> under the guidance of his guru
        <strong>Premji K Bhasi</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        An enthusiastic learner with a deep curiosity for music, he is especially
        fascinated by <em>rāgas</em>—their structure, personality, and the subtle
        magic through which they communicate emotion and meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
        This space is a personal attempt to explore, document, and reflect on rāgas
        as living musical entities rather than mere scales.
