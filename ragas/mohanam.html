            <h2>Introduction To Ragam</h2>
            <p>
                Mōhanam is a pentatonic (audava) rāga in Carnatic music and is traditionally classified as a janya of Harikāmbhōji (28th Melakarta). Some scholars also associate it with Mechakalyāṇi or Śaṅkarābharaṇam based on its rāga lakṣaṇa.
In Hindustani music, its equivalent is Bhūp (also called Bhūpālī). Mōhanam is one of the most widely used pentatonic scales in the world and appears prominently in East and Southeast Asian musical traditions, including those of China and Japan.

            <h2>Rāga Lakṣaṇam</h2>
            <p>
                Mōhanam derives its beauty from simplicity and symmetry.
                With only five swaras, it creates a bright and expansive soundscape.

            <p>
                Joyful, auspicious, and calm. Mōhanam rewards restraint
                and clarity more than speed.

            <h2>Personal Notes</h2>
            <p>
                Responds well when the mind is calm. Over-speeding
                reduces its depth.
